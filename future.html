              <h2>Virtual reality (VR)</h2>
              <p>Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet.

                Before people had to travel halfway across the globe in order to see a monument per say. With the introduction of television and smartphones people could see images of these places with a click. Now however, we have achieved virtual reality. It allows the user to live in that place without having to leave the room. It is not only implemented in gaming but also is used for military training and sightseeing</p>
